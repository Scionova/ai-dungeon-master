# Memory Bank

This folder contains the Memory Bank for the Tabletop RPG DM Agent System. The Memory Bank provides complete project context for AI assistants to understand the project after memory resets.

## Structure

### Core Files (Read These First)

1. **[projectbrief.md](projectbrief.md)** - Project vision, goals, and scope
2. **[productContext.md](productContext.md)** - User problems and experience goals
3. **[systemPatterns.md](systemPatterns.md)** - Architecture patterns and design decisions
4. **[techContext.md](techContext.md)** - Technology stack and development setup
5. **[activeContext.md](activeContext.md)** - Current work focus and recent changes
6. **[progress.md](progress.md)** - What's implemented, what's left, known issues

### Reference Files

7. **[toolsCatalog.md](toolsCatalog.md)** - Complete catalog of tools by agent type
8. **[futureFeatures.md](futureFeatures.md)** - Development phases, roadmap, open questions

### Task Tracking

- **[tasks/_index.md](tasks/_index.md)** - Master list of all tasks with statuses
- **tasks/TASKXXX-*.md** - Individual task files with detailed tracking

## Reading Order

For complete project understanding:

1. Start with `projectbrief.md` for high-level vision
2. Read `productContext.md` for user perspective
3. Review `systemPatterns.md` for architecture
4. Check `techContext.md` for technical details
5. Read `activeContext.md` for current state
6. Review `progress.md` for implementation status
7. Check `toolsCatalog.md` when working with tools
8. Review `futureFeatures.md` for roadmap and planning
9. Check `tasks/_index.md` for active work

## When to Update

Update Memory Bank files when:

- Implementing significant changes
- Making architectural decisions
- Adding new features
- Discovering patterns
- User requests "update memory bank"

Always update:
- `activeContext.md` - After each work session
- `progress.md` - When features are completed
- `tasks/_index.md` - When task status changes

## Integration with Architecture Docs

Memory Bank provides narrative context and current state tracking.

- `../README.md` - User-facing documentation

Memory Bank is optimized for AI consumption and contains all project documentation.
