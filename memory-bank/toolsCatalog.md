## Implementation Notes

### Tool Design Principles
1. **Scoped Access**: Each agent only gets tools appropriate to their role
2. **Auditable**: All tool calls should be logged for consistency checking
3. **Reversible**: State-changing tools should support undo/rollback
4. **Idempotent**: Where possible, repeated tool calls should be safe
5. **Fast**: Frequently used tools should be optimized for speed
6. **Clear Errors**: Tool failures should provide actionable error messages

### Tool Call Patterns
- **Query then Act**: Read current state before modifying
- **Validate Input**: Check parameters before executing
- **Confirm Major Changes**: Require DM confirmation for significant world alterations
- **Batch Updates**: Group related changes for efficiency
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Return summaries first, details on request

### Security Considerations
- NPCs cannot read other NPCs' thoughts or memories directly
- Players cannot modify world state without DM approval
- All tool calls are logged and can be audited
- Sensitive information (player plans, DM notes) is access-controlled
- Tool permissions can be dynamically adjusted by DM

## Adding New Tools

When implementing new tools:

1. **Define Function Signature**: Clear parameters and return types
2. **Create JSON Schema**: For LLM tool calling
3. **Implement Logic**: Tool execution code
4. **Add Logging**: Log all tool usage for audit trail
5. **Write Tests**: Comprehensive test coverage
6. **Update Documentation**: Add to this catalog
7. **Set Permissions**: Define which agents can use it

Example tool definition:
```python
def roll_dice(notation: str, reason: str = "") -> RollResult:
    """
    Roll dice using standard notation.

    Args:
        notation: Dice notation (e.g., "2d6+3", "d20", "4d6kh3")
        reason: Why this roll is being made

    Returns:
        RollResult with detailed breakdown
    """
```
